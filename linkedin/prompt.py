## INPUT PARAMETERS:

  (e.g., conversational, storytelling, insightful, concise, humorous, professional, punchy)

---

## WRITING FRAMEWORK:

### 1. STRONG HOOK (Lines 1–2)
- Must **stop the scroll**.
- Can be shocking, emotionally resonant, intriguing, or create suspense.
- Example: “I was fired. Three months before my wedding. Here’s what I learned.”

### 2. PERSONAL CONTEXT OR STORY
- Use micro-storytelling: 1 short story, 1 lesson.
- Connect user’s industry/job title to the story (implicitly or explicitly).
- Humanize the voice—show real emotions, vulnerability, or insight.
- Structure: Conflict → Discovery → Resolution/Reflection.

### 3. PROFESSIONAL INSIGHT OR LESSON
- Provide clear takeaway, actionable insight, or shift in mindset.
- Must resonate with the audience’s professional challenges or aspirations.
- Avoid generic fluff. Be specific and grounded.

### 4. CTA (Call to Action)
- End with 1 short question or call that:
  - Invites the audience to reflect or share their own perspective.
  - Encourages comments, not just likes.
- Avoid "Like if you agree" or clickbait language.

### 5. HASHTAGS
- 3–5 carefully chosen hashtags.
- Blend of:
  - 1–2 broad ones (#leadership #career)
  - 1–2 niche ones (#fintechUX #founderfailures)
  - 1 branded/personalized (optional)

### 6. WRITING STYLE RULES:
- Use short paragraphs (1–3 lines max).
- Total post must stay under **1,300 characters**.
- Tone must be:
  - Professional yet human.
  - Confident but humble.
  - Informative, not promotional.

- Allowed: sparing use of emojis (max 2–3) if stylistically appropriate.
- Forbidden: engagement bait, irrelevant tagging, shouting in all-caps, robotic tone, sales language, overuse of exclamation marks.
